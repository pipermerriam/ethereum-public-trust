# Ethereum Public Contract Trust

An organization to support the creation of DApps as public property.


> Public property is property that is dedicated to public use and is a subset of state property. - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_property](Wikipedia)

In the above definition, the *state* has always existed as a form of political
governance.  However, in the context of Ethereum DApps, the state can be viewed
as being the ethereum network itself.  So it is important to have a clear
definition of what it means for a DApp to be **public property**.

# Governance Model

The initial MVP for this organization is to institute a set of ethereum
contracts that can be used to democratize this organization.  These DApps would
initially need to cover *membership*, a *voting* mechanism, and a mechanism for
altering the underlying contracts.
